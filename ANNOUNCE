syb: Scrap Your Boilerplate!
================================================================================

Scrap Your Boilerplate (SYB) is a library for generic programming in Haskell. It 
is supported since the GHC >= 6.0 implementation of Haskell. Using this 
approach, you can write generic functions such as traversal schemes (e.g., 
everywhere and everything), as well as generic read, generic show and generic 
equality (i.e., gread, gshow, and geq). This approach is based on just a few 
primitives for type-safe cast and processing constructor applications. 

It was originally developed by Ralf Lämmel and Simon Peyton Jones. Since then, 
many people have contributed with research relating to SYB or its applications.

What's new
----------

The biggest improvements from version 0.1 are:
  * Reintegration of the testsuite;
  * Introduction of the Generics.SYB.* module hierarchy (as synonyms for their
    Data.Generics.* counterparts);
  * Adding gshows :: Data a => a -> ShowS (more efficient than gshow);
  * Adding gmapAccumA :: forall b d a. (Data d, Applicative a)
                      => (forall e. Data e => b -> e -> (b, a e))
                      -> b -> d -> (b, a d) ;
  * Adding ext1B :: (Data a, Typeable1 t)
                 => a -> (forall b. Data b => (t b)) -> a ;
  * Introduction of two new generic producers ('empty' and 'constrs'). The
    former produces an empty value of a given datatype, while the latter
    produces a list of values of a datatype, each using a different constructor.
